0,Heterogeneous Firms in International Markets and Gender Inequalities: New Evidence from Vietnam,"Recent contributions in international economics have highlighted structural differences between firms actively participating in global markets and firms mostly operating in the domestic economy. Using firm-level data from Vietnam, this study found that foreign and domestic firms with global ties – exporters, multinational enterprises (MNEs), and domestic firms belonging to global value chains (GVCs) – play an important role in reducing gendered differences in employment opportunities in the formal sector, in particular for low-skilled women workers. Women workers are more likely than men workers to be employed in low-wage firms, but this gender gap is lower in MNEs, in particular those belonging to GVCs. This study provides evidence of important within-sector heterogeneity not only based on firms’ ownership but also on the intensity of participation in GVCs.","['Nicola Daniele Coniglio', 'Rezart Hoxhaj']","['/author/daniele+coniglio%2c+nicola', '/author/hoxhaj%2c+rezart']",291,0,"'gender inequality', 'fdi', 'global value chains', 'globalization', 'vietnam'","['F23', 'F16', 'J16']",Pages 1-28,10 Apr 2022,4,2022,28,,"Recent contributions in international economics have highlighted structural differences between firms actively participating in global markets and firms mostly operating in the domestic economy.

Education, Legal Awareness, and Intimate Partner Violence","This article exploits the rollout of the 1997 Basic Education Program in Turkey, a reform that extended compulsory school attendance, to estimate the causal effects of education on women’s awareness of laws designed to reduce gender inequality and prevent domestic violence. The study implements a regression-discontinuity design and finds that the additional years of schooling improved women’s legal awareness. Women exposed to the education reform were more likely to have heard about the new laws and services through newspapers, journals, or books.

3,The Gendered Outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Although South Korea is well-known for its aggressive response to COVID-19, little is known about how the risk of infection manifests differently by gender. Using real-time data on confirmed cases, this study empirically examines the gendered outbreak of COVID-19 driven by occupational segregation in South Korea. It investigates gender differences in risk of work-related exposure, particularly for those jobs where essential activities are conducted, such as in the healthcare sector, and that are dominated by women. The results from the multinomial logit model confirm that women have a higher risk of workplace exposure than men, particularly in pink-collar and care jobs.

4,Happily Ever After? Mental Health Effects of Early Marriage in Indonesia,"Early marriage is a manifestation of gender discrimination against girls, leading to adverse consequences on their well-being. This article contributes to the literature by examining the effects of early marriage on the mental well-being of women – an area often overlooked in research. Using nationally representative longitudinal data from Indonesia and applying difference-in-differences regression model with fixed-effects, this study finds that marrying early, particularly by the age of 18 years, has a strong negative impact on women’s mental health. Specifically, women who marry early are 9.6 percentage points more likely to be depressed. It further finds that a one-year delay in marriage decreases the likelihood of women having depression by approximately four percent of the mean. These findings add to the evidence of adverse health effects of early marriage and provide a rationale for policy interventions implemented toward eradicating it.",['Danusha Jayawardana'],['/author/jayawardana%2c+danusha'],215,0,"'marriage', 'women', 'indonesia', 'mental health', 'difference-in-differences'","['J12', 'J16', 'O12']",Pages 112-136,12 Jul 2022,4,2022,28,,"Early marriage is a manifestation of gender discrimination against girls, leading to adverse consequences on their well-being.

5,Sticky Floors and Glass Ceilings: Gender Wage Gap in Egypt,"The fact that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the lowest labor force participation rate for women in the world has been extensively studied, but discrimination in pay against working women has received considerably less attention. Using recently available datasets, this study examines the distribution of wages (inequality) across men and women employed in the public versus the private sector in Egypt. The analysis shows that because working women tend to be more educated than working men, the gender wage gap would have been larger if women had the same endowments. Quantile regressions and recentered influence functions show that the gender wage gap is wide at the top of the distribution, primarily in the public sector, which is a sign of a glass ceiling.

6,Gender Division of Household Labor in the United States: How Does Culture Operate?,"This article examines the ways in which culture plays a role in the gender division of household labor. To explore this issue, the study uses data on early-arrival first- and second-generation immigrants living in the United States who have a married/unmarried partner present in the household. Because all of these individuals have grown up under the same laws, institutions, and economic conditions that prevail in the US, the differences between them in the gender division of housework may be attributed to cultural differences in their countries of ancestry. The study finds that the stronger the culture of gender equality in the country of ancestry, the greater the equality in immigrants’ current division of housework. This result is maintained when considering both housework and childcare as household labor. This work is extended by examining how culture operates and is transmitted, and whether culture may influence the work–life balance.","['Miriam Marcén', 'Marina Morales']","['/author/marc%c3%a9n%2c+miriam', '/author/morales%2c+marina']",192,0,"'culture', 'time use', 'housework', 'gender', 'division of labor'","['D1', 'J1', 'Z10']",Pages 166-193,17 Jul 2022,4,2022,28,,"This article examines the ways in which culture plays a role in the gender division of household labor.

7,How Entry into Parenthood Shapes Gender Role Attitudes: New Evidence from The UK,"People’s attitudes about how paid and unpaid work should be divided between the members of a couple determine gendered socioeconomic outcomes to a great extent. It is thus important to understand how gender role attitudes (GRA) are formed and evolve. This article concentrates on a path-breaking event in life: becoming a parent. Using longitudinal data from the United Kingdom, the study shows that, in general, becoming a parent significantly shifts women’s GRA toward more traditional positions but leaves men’s attitudes unaffected. Prenatal attitudes are a critical factor. After parenthood occurs, results find a substantial traditionalization of attitudes for (both) progressive parents, while no significant change is observed for parents with conservative prenatal attitudes.

8,Poverty and Intrahousehold Gender Inequality in Time Use in Ghana,"How gender-based differences in time spent on household and labor-market activities affect men’s and women’s well-being is of growing interest to economists and policymakers. In many countries, women perform more unpaid work than men and have fewer opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty through education and training. This article analyzes the relationship between poverty and gender inequality in time use among monogamous couples in Ghana. A key finding is that women in poor households face heterogeneous levels of inequality in time use, depending on the type of activity, inequality in time use, and characteristics of the household. The study highlights the importance of devising gender-aware policies and altering entrenched cultural stereotypes, thereby helping to reduce inequality between men and women. This should afford more women the opportunity to play a more productive and economically meaningful role in the formal labor market.","['Emmanuel Orkoh', 'Carike Claassen', 'Derick Blaauw']","['/author/orkoh%2c+emmanuel', '/author/claassen%2c+carike', '/author/blaauw%2c+derick']",285,0,"'poverty', 'gender inequality', 'time use', 'tobit', 'conditional mixed-process model'","['D13', 'I32', 'J16']",Pages 221-253,25 Jul 2022,4,2022,28,,"How gender-based differences in time spent on household and labor-market activities affect men’s and women’s well-being is of growing interest to economists and policymakers.

9,Sugarcane Commercialization and Gender Experiences in the Zambian “Sweetest Town”,"This article explores how sugarcane commercialization impacts gender relations, and processes that shape them, using two differently structured outgrower schemes – a settlement scheme and an European Union-driven block farm in southern Zambia. Results show gendered impacts across the schemes are complex and are shaped by diverse cultural arrangements as micro-processes. Intrahousehold patterns of decision making, land, and labor dynamics reveal that changing the structure, organization, and integration of outgrower schemes does not necessarily make them responsive to strategic gender needs. Further, these processes are insufficient in altering pre-existing sociocultural imbalances. Consequently, even where schemes are intentional about being inclusive, they are likely to replicate structural inequalities and fail to engender transformational changes among participants.

10,"Gender Wage Gap, Gender Norms, and Long-Term Care: A Theoretical Framework","Population aging in developed and developing economies has led to increasing number of older persons in need of care, posing a challenge to the social arrangements of care and creating important aggregate economic implications. This article proposes a simple theoretical framework to evaluate the interplay of gender norms and the gender wage gap, as well as specific characteristics of the paid care market such as occupational segregation and market power rents. By incorporating a degree of substitutability between women’s and men’s care work, the model shows how declines in the gender wage gap have small effects on the division of long-term care work in the presence of persistent gender norms.

16,Underground Employment: Analyzing the Job Quality of New York City Subway Dancers,"This paper analyzes the New York City subway phenomenon known as “showtime.” Using an individuals-in-relation framework and drawing on Marxist and feminist economic perspectives, it investigates the job quality of subway dancing as a type of informal self-employment. The data come from thirty-four in-depth interviews conducted in 2016. The paper contextualizes earnings, hours, and conditions of work by considering the social relations and power dynamics in which they are embedded. While dancers articulate advantages of this work, such as setting one’s own schedule and having a creative outlet, they also articulate disadvantages, most notably the risk of being arrested. While the dancers see performing on the subway as productively contributing to New York City, the police categorize this activity as a crime.

17,Gender Disparities in Post-Conflict Societies: A Cross-National Analysis,"This article investigates the impacts of conflict, resolution, and post-conflict democracy on gender bias. Exploring this question poses two methodological concerns. The first regards selection bias in which countries experience conflict and its resolution. The study addresses this issue using a generalization of the Heckman procedure. The second is that post-conflict democracy is likely endogenous to the level of pre-conflict democracy. This issue is addressed using two-stage least squares. Results show that conflict unambiguously worsens gender outcomes with respect to secondary school enrollment, labor force participation, fertility, and parliamentary representation. However, it does not affect the gap in life expectancy. Conflict resolution improves gender outcomes significantly, but not always by a magnitude that restores pre-conflict levels of equality. Greater post-conflict democratization improves parliamentary representation of women and the gender gaps in life expectancy and secondary school enrollment.

Evidence from eleven countries in Asia-Pacific indicates that the impact of the pandemic goes far beyond health consequences. With children out of school, intensified care needs of elderly and ill family members, and labor markets in turmoil, demands for unpaid domestic and care work have increased substantially. Results show that women are disproportionately shouldering the burden of unpaid care and domestic work triggered by the lockdowns, and they are losing their livelihoods faster than men.

This study examines whether the impacts of the lockdown on employment differed by gender in areas surrounding Delhi. An ongoing monthly employment survey between March 2019 and May 2020 allows for comparison before and after lockdown. Estimates based on random-effects logistic regression models show that for men, the predicted probability of employment declined from 0.88 to 0.57, while for women it fell from 0.34 to 0.22. Women’s concentration in self-employment may be one reason why their employment was somewhat protected. However, when looking only at wage workers, the study finds that women experienced greater job losses than men with predicted probability of employment declining by 72 percent for women compared to 40 percent for men.

29,Transformations in the Gender Gaps in Paid and Unpaid Work During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from Turkey,"This paper uses a unique survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey to analyze men’s and women’s time use under lockdown. The study finds that while men’s participation in unpaid work increased, particularly for men who switched to working from home, the relative increase for women further widened the gender gap in unpaid work. The gender gap in paid work narrowed due to relatively less employment disruption for women and a relatively higher decrease in men’s paid work. The total workload of employed women reached levels that make it hard to sustain a decent work–life balance. Disparities in unpaid work among women by education and employment status decreased, reflecting how purchasing power became somewhat irrelevant under the pandemic measures.

Disparities in unpaid work among women by education and employment status decreased, reflecting how purchasing power became somewhat irrelevant under the pandemic measures. These findings unveil simultaneously the fragility of the work–life balance conditions faced by employed women and a window of opportunity created by men’s increased participation in unpaid work.","['covid-19', 'unpaid work', 'turkey']",,"j16,j22,o52",288-309,0,1
30,Equality in Confinement: Nonnormative Divisions of Labor in Spanish Dual-Earner Families During the Covid-19 Lockdown,"This study analyzes the intrahousehold division of labor within heterosexual couples with children during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. The strict confinement established could be regarded as an exogenous shock creating, for some families, theoretically favorable conditions for arrangements that deviate from traditionally gendered dynamics. The disappearance of time constraints from presential work and the impossibility of outsourcing housework and childcare gave highly educated, high-resource women in dual-earner, teleworking couples a unique opportunity to negotiate balanced distributions of work. An online survey carried out during the Spanish lockdown reveals that in most cases egalitarian and nonnormative arrangements were established. Time-availability factors emerge as crucial for this achievement. Nevertheless, a non-negligible proportion of these families exhibit traditional domestic work patterns, which highlights the resilience of normative structures binding women to the household sphere.

44,Gender and Asset Ownership in the Old and New Lands of Egypt,"The Middle East and North Africa region has the lowest level of women’s land ownership in the world, yet little research has explored the barriers and opportunities women face in land ownership in the region. This paper identifies patterns, opportunities, and constraints of ownership of land and other assets (houses, livestock, poultry, and gold) by women and men in the Old and New Lands of Egypt.

Using two aggregate measures of segregation the study shows that occupational and sectoral segregation has increased over time in many countries. It finds that income levels have no impact on occupational or sectoral segregation; trade openness has little impact on sectoral segregation but increases occupational segregation. Rising female labor force participation is associated with falling sectoral but increasing occupational segregation; rising education levels tend to increase rather than decrease segregation.

This study explores the timing and sequencing of policy to address reproductive health needs and to strengthen labor market institutions and social protection, illustrated by case studies from six developing countries – Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, South Africa, the Philippines, and Vietnam – which have similar demographic transitions but divergent labor market outcomes for women. The findings suggest that where fertility transitions have been sharpest, this has not automatically translated into more employment and better labor market outcomes for women – illuminating a critical role for policy to support women’s transition into formal employment.","['informal economy', 'vulnerable employment', 'fertility', 'labor market participation']",,"j21,j13",121-153,0,0
59,"Culture, Labor Supply, and Fertility Across Immigrant Generations in the United States","Recent immigration to the United States and other developed nations has increasingly been from countries that have relatively traditional gender norms. This study uses data from the Current Population Survey for 2000–14 to investigate how source-country gender norms influence the labor supply and fertility of married women across immigrant generations in the US. It finds that immigrants’ and descendants’ labor supply and fertility are associated with the female-to-male labor force participation ratio and total fertility rate in the source country; importantly, the association declines across successive generations. Husbands’ source-country characteristics are also associated with the labor supply and fertility of immigrant women.

60,"The Demographic Transition and Women's Economic Participation in Tamil Nadu, India: A Historical Case Study","This study analyzes the co-evolution of economic, social, governmental, and gender systems; the demographic transition; and women’s extra-domestic productive opportunities in Tamil Nadu, India. It examines how gender norms for women’s extra-domestic productive and domestic reproductive (motherhood) roles interacted with other upheavals in demography, society, and economy, and how these interweaving trends were reflected in women’s actual participation – and gender gaps – in higher education and employment. The study finds that higher education and employment for women at peak productive and reproductive ages rose as fertility declined, likely aided by Tamil Nadu’s history of social activism and investment in educational and economic infrastructure. However, motherhood remained a primary responsibility even after fertility declined, moving from a focus on childbearing to a focus on childrearing.

Nevertheless, there is an overwhelming agreement on the need to fight against forced sex work. This paper uses a formal economic model in order to analyze how a law – introduced to punish clients of commercial sex services – affects market outcomes. More specifically, it examines how the so-called “neo-abolitionism” or “Nordic” prostitution regime impacts forced sex work. The theoretical analysis reveals that this effect is ambiguous and crucially depends on the size of the deterrence effect and on local properties of the market demand.

73,What women want (their men to do): Housework and Satisfaction in Australian Households,"The time allocated to household chores is substantial, with the burden falling disproportionately upon women. Social norms about how much housework men and women should do are likely to influence couples’ housework allocation decisions and satisfaction. Using Australian data spanning 2001–14, this study employs a two-stage estimation procedure to examine how deviations from housework norms relate to couples’ satisfaction. The study finds that satisfaction is negatively affected by predicted housework time and that women’s satisfaction, but not men’s, is robustly affected by their partners’ residual housework time.

Results indicate that greater income generation by women in rural areas in most economic activities (coffee, fruits, commerce, and industry) decreases domestic violence, while in services, the opposite occurs.

This study uses American Community Survey data from 2010 to 2014 to calculate poverty rates for households headed by different-sex versus same-sex couples. Comparing households with similar characteristics, the results show that those headed by same-sex couples are more likely to be in poverty than those headed by different-sex married couples. Despite that overall disadvantage, a decomposition of the poverty risk shows that same-sex couples are protected from poverty by their higher levels of education and labor force participation, and their lower probability of having a child in the home.

Using the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) to measure empathy, the study finds that more empathic people support more interventionist policies. While greater empathy leads both men and women to support more government action, there is no gender difference in the effects of empathy on policy views.

This contribution draws on political economy, critical food studies, and feminist economics to analyze the US National School Lunch Program, one of the world's oldest and largest government-sponsored school lunch programs. It makes visible the social and environmental costs of the “heat-and-serve” economy, where widely used metrics consider only the speed and volume of service as productive work. This study demonstrates that such a narrow understanding of the labor of lunch devalues care and undercuts the potential for school food provisioning to promote ecological and feminist goals. Further, it proposes a “high road” alternative and outlines an agenda for reorganizing school food provisioning to maximize care in all its dimensions.","['Jennifer Gaddis', 'Amy K.

Anchored within the world of finance – an industry predicated on mathematical theorizing, neoclassical economic thought, and omission of relational values – the inclusion of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, a commonly used term for nonfinancial information in SRI, in investment decision making confronts several barriers. One such barrier concerns care: who cares for what, and where. In an environment where an atomistic-individualistic ontology dominates, and a relational-values ontology is omitted, the study investigates the possibilities for ESG to have a wider uptake.

106,The Monetized Economy Versus Care and the Environment: Degrowth Perspectives On Reconciling an Antagonism,"This paper addresses the question of how the current growth paradigm perpetuates existing gender and environmental injustices and investigates whether these can be mitigated through a degrowth work-sharing proposal. It uses an adapted framework of the “ICE model” to illustrate how ecological processes and caring activities are structurally devalued by the monetized economy in a growth paradigm. On the one hand, this paradigm perpetuates gender injustices by reinforcing dualisms and devaluing care. On the other hand, environmental injustices are perpetuated since “green growth” does not succeed in dematerializing production processes. In its critique of the growth imperative, degrowth not only promotes the alleviation of environmental injustices but also calls for a recentering of society around care. This paper concludes that, if designed in a gender-sensitive way, a degrowth work-sharing proposal as part of a broader value transformation has the potential to address both gender and environmental injustices.","['Corinna Dengler', 'Birte Strunk']","['/author/dengler%2c+corinna', '/author/strunk%2c+birte']",4264,4,"'degrowth', 'gender inequality', 'sustainability', 'work sharing', 'gender working time equality', 'caring economy'",[],Pages 160-183,20 Oct 2017,3,2018,24,,"This paper addresses the question of how the current growth paradigm perpetuates existing gender and environmental injustices and investigates whether these can be mitigated through a degrowth work-sharing proposal.

107,Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding in Urban China,"Using data from the 2010 Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status, this contribution estimates the effect of paid maternity leave on breastfeeding duration in urban China during the 1988–2008 period. The analysis applies a policy-based identification strategy to control for the endogenous relationship between paid leave entitlements and breastfeeding decisions. Estimates show that paid maternity leave has a strong positive effect on breastfeeding duration. Specifically, if the length of paid leave increases by thirty days, then the probability of breastfeeding for at least six months increases by 12 percentage points. Between 1988 and 2008, the average length of paid leave for mothers without a college education decreased by twenty-three days, which reduced these mothers’ probability of breastfeeding for at least six months by 9 percentage points. These results support the view that paid maternity leave enhances the ability of employed women to sustain breastfeeding and call for universal paid leave entitlements.","['Nan Jia', 'Xiao-yuan Dong', 'Yue-ping Song']","['/author/jia%2c+nan', '/author/dong%2c+xiao-yuan', '/author/song%2c+yue-ping']",4332,2,"'breastfeeding', 'maternal employment', 'paid maternity leave', 'chinese women'","['J01', 'J08', 'J33']",Pages 31-53,08 Nov 2017,2,2018,24,"The Care Economy, Gender, and Inclusive Growth in China","Using data from the 2010 Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status, this contribution estimates the effect of paid maternity leave on breastfeeding duration in urban China during the 1988–2008 period.

It focuses on the roles that childcare and household composition play in the employment decisions of prime-age married individuals of Muslim and non-Muslim ethnicity. Using the 2012 China Household Ethnicity Survey (CHES), the study finds that children generally decrease women's likelihood of employment outside the home and increase men's. The gender gap in the probability of off-farm employment is larger for those of Muslim ethnicity. Non-Muslim parents of sons are more likely to migrate for employment than parents of daughters. The presence of women of grandparent age (46–70) universally facilitates labor migration. Men of grandparent age tend to increase only the probability that non-Muslim parents migrate for employment.

This paper also uses cross-state and time variation in divorce law adoption by including additional data from the early 1990s to estimate the effect of a state’s adoption of unilateral divorce on daily time use. The analysis confirms the findings for women in the 1970s: the availability of unilateral divorce substantially decreases married women’s time spent on housework.

The results are consistent with gender discrimination on wages and suggest that women’s occupational paths are often an outcome of limited choices, and that women’s unpaid domestic work negatively interferes with the energy women can put into paid work.

Using a non-equilibrium structuralist macroeconomic model, it demonstrates that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in men’s and women’s employment can be achieved by adopting gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies. Based on historical data series, three scenarios for Europe for the 2015–25 period are compared: continued austerity, a gender-neutral expansionary scenario, and a gendered expansionary scenario. Projections for the gendered expansionary scenario suggest that 7.4 million more jobs could be created for women in the Eurozone and United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies and gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under this scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits.

Projections for the gendered expansionary scenario suggest that 7.4 million more jobs could be created for women in the Eurozone and United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies and gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under this scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits. The study recommends Europe should roll back austerity policies and embark on a new gender-aware economic trajectory.","['europe', 'crisis', 'austerity', 'fiscal policy', 'employment', 'gender inequality']",,"n14,e17,h5",225-249,0,0
134,Does Off-Farm Wage Employment Make Women in Rural Senegal Happy?,"This paper investigates the impact of wage employment on women’s well-being in the Senegalese horticultural export industry. It uses a subjective well-being approach, based on self-reported happiness, to capture income and non-income aspects of employment. The study uses original survey data from 2013 for the Saint-Louis region in Senegal and an instrumental variable approach, supported by information from focus group discussions. It finds that women’s employment improves subjective well-being for the poorest women, but not for women whose household income is above the poverty threshold. Women’s employment improves women’s happiness through an income effect, as it leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects reduce women’s happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload and low job satisfaction due to unfulfilled expectations. The positive income effect outweighs these negative non-income effects for poor women but not for relatively wealthier women.","['Goedele Van den Broeck', 'Miet Maertens']","['/author/van+den+broeck%2c+goedele', '/author/maertens%2c+miet']",568,9,"'women’s employment', 'subjective well-being', 'globalization', 'senegal', 'sub-saharan africa'","['E24', 'I31', 'O12']",Pages 250-275,14 Jul 2017,4,2017,23,,"This paper investigates the impact of wage employment on women’s well-being in the Senegalese horticultural export industry.

148,Does Women’s Labor Force Participation Reduce Domestic Violence? Evidence from Jordan,"Enhancing women’s labor force participation is seen as a way to promote their empowerment and improve their well-being and that of their children. The empirical literature on the relationship between women’s employment status and domestic violence is less clear-cut. Using quantitative data from Jordan in 2007, this study explores the effect of women’s employment, as measured by their participation in paid work outside the home, on reported domestic violence, controlling for the potential endogeneity of women’s employment, which might bias the relationship between employment and domestic violence.

Yet growing pressure and desire to join the paid workforce suggest that the gender contract may be changing.

164,Remittances and Household Expenditures on Education in Ghana's Northern Region: Why Gender Matters,"Studies of the impact of migrant remittances on receiving households assume that these households act as a unit in receiving remittances and making decisions about their use. Thus, many of these studies use the gender of the household head as a key control variable. This study questions this assumption, using original qualitative and quantitative data on rural–urban migration of women in Ghana to show that gendered social norms of household provisioning influence the intrahousehold flow of remittances.

This study finds that since the mid 1980s, export growth in developing countries is associated with feminization in some countries and a defeminization in others.

It finds that the capital intensity of production, evidenced by shifts in labor productivity, is negatively and significantly related to shifts in the female share of employment in manufacturing, while exports are statistically insignificant.

Evidence from a Western Ugandan Coffee Cooperative,"Women smallholders face greater constraints than men in accessing capital and commodity markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Collective action has been promoted to remedy those disadvantages. Using survey data of 421 women members and 210 nonmembers of a coffee producer cooperative in Western Uganda, this study investigates the determinants of women's participation in cooperatives and women's intensity of participation. The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action.

The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action.

180,Lost in Representation? Feminist identity Economics and Women's Agency in India's Local Governments,"In India, since 1992, quotas for women in local councils are a key policy mechanism to secure gender equality in political participation and foster rural development. Affirmative action measures were expected to particularly enhance women's agency regarding decisions on decentralized service delivery. However, to date, this potentially transformative reform to the local government system has produced mixed results. This study updates identity economics with intersectional and institutional theories to shed light on the agency of elected women representatives (EWRs) in different federal states of India. The findings show that institutions, including social norms, entail specific identity costs that reinforce stereotyped accounts on women's political agency. Additional policy measures are required to address the incurred costs and render quotas for women effective.

Efforts promoting joint ownership, for example, joint titling and marital property laws supporting joint ownership, should not only consider these complexities but also establish and communicate clear and enforceable rules for joint ownership.","['common property', 'gender difference', 'intrahousehold', 'economics gender', 'survey research', 'family law']",,"j16,d19,d63",23-55,0,0
195,Patriarchy and Property Rights among Yoruba Women in Nigeria,"In most patriarchal societies, women's property rights are often achieved vicariously, usually through their husbands. By contrast, among the Yoruba of Nigeria, women have some levels of autonomy and independence such that they can accumulate property to which their husbands have no claim, yet they customarily do not have any inheritance right to their husbands’ property. This study examines how this gender-equitable property rights regime affects gender relations at the household and societal levels through in-depth interviews conducted in 2012 with fifty-six purposively selected women property owners who lived in urban Ibadan, Nigeria. Findings include that though economic power has improved the status of the women and contributes to development of their communities, it has not yet translated into equity in decision making.

Simulations provide evidence that the difference between mothers and fathers comes almost completely from differences in their subjective well-being rather than from differences in how they use their time.","['time use', 'subjective well-being', 'childcare', 'gender wage gap', 'happiness', 'experience emotion']",,"d13,j13,j16",1-34,1,0
211,Women's Paid Work and Intimate Partner Violence: Insights from Tanzania,"Theoretical and empirical research provide conflicting views on whether women who do paid work are less at risk from violence by an intimate partner in low- and middle-income countries. Economic household-bargaining models propose increased access to monetary resources will enhance women's “agency” and hence their bargaining power within the household, which reduces their vulnerability to intimate-partner violence. Feminist theorists also argue, however, that culture, context, and social norms can impede women's ability to access and benefit from employment. This study uses semi-structured interviews conducted in 2009 to explore the implications of paid work among women market traders in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, Tanzania. While in this sample, informal-sector work did not result in women being able to fully exercise agency, their access to money did have a positive effect on their lives and reduced one major source of conflict and trigger for violence: that of negotiating money from men.","['Seema Vyas', 'Jessie Mbwambo', 'Lori Heise']","['/author/vyas%2c+seema', '/author/mbwambo%2c+jessie', '/author/heise%2c+lori']",1217,39,"'bargaining power', 'employment', 'gender relations', 'violence against women', 'tanzania'","['B54', 'C78', 'J16']",Pages 35-58,21 Jul 2014,1,2015,21,,"Theoretical and empirical research provide conflicting views on whether women who do paid work are less at risk from violence by an intimate partner in low- and middle-income countries.

212,Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence From Norway,"Universal parental leaves with job protection and earnings compensation increase women's labor market attachment, but very long leaves may have negative consequences at both individual and societal levels. Using panel data from the period 1996–2010, we study whether it is possible to offset the potential negative effects on women's labor supply of long parental leaves by policies targeted especially at fathers, and policies making formal daycare cheaper and more easily available. Norway is used as example, since all recent extensions in the parental leave scheme have been reserved for fathers and at the same time the daycare sector has expanded rapidly. We find that Norwegian mothers did enter work faster after childbirth in the late 2000s than a decade earlier.

Regression analysis conducted on an unbalanced panel of 101 countries taken over nonoverlapping five-year periods from 1990 to 2000 reveals that a standard deviation improvement in equality in economic opportunity increases growth by 1.3 percentage points and a corresponding improvement in participatory equality improves growth by an average of about 1.2 percentage points.

Women's Narratives of Compliance and Contestation in Urban Afghanistan,"There has been an ideological tug-of-war over women's place in Afghan society from the early years of the twentieth century between the modernizing tendencies of its urban-based elite and the forces of conservatism represented by the Islamic ulema (religious leaders).

It demonstrates that the gender wealth gap is concentrated in particular types of assets, and differences in the composition of wealth, especially in high net worth households, are an important feature of the wealth gap in Australia. Using decomposition techniques within a quantile regression framework, the study explores the effects of individual characteristics of single male and female households on their wealth and finds that individual factors play a relatively small role in accounting for the large gender wealth gap at the top of the wealth distribution.

242,Who Owns the Land? Perspectives from Rural Ugandans and Implications for Large-Scale Land Acquisitions,"Rapidly growing demand for agricultural land is putting pressure on property-rights systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where customary tenure systems have provided secure land access.

243,Small and Productive: Kenyan Women and Crop Choice,"The question of gender differences in agricultural productivity has received particular attention in the development literature. The stylized fact that women produce less than men, while on average occupying smaller farms, presents a quandary as it is also a stylized fact that smaller farms have higher yields per unit of area. Using data from the 2006 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey, this study examines whether there is a gap in output per acre between men and women farmers in Kenya. Using ordinary and two-stage least-squares (OLS and 2SLS) analyses, it shows that when crop choice is taken into account, women are as productive as men. Specifically, the study finds that market-oriented crops are the source of differences. This suggests that further research into what determines crop choice is needed, in addition to policy that ensures that women have the same access as men to support for market-oriented crops.","['Mwangi wa Gĩthĩnji', 'Charalampos Konstantinidis', 'Andrew Barenberg']","['/author/wa+g%c4%a9th%c4%a9nji%2c+mwangi', '/author/konstantinidis%2c+charalampos', '/author/barenberg%2c+andrew']",952,18,"'agriculture', 'women farmers', 'kenya', 'africa', 'inverse relationship', 'crop choice'","['B54', 'N57', 'O13']",Pages 101-129,07 Feb 2014,1,2014,20,"Land, Gender, and Food Security","The question of gender differences in agricultural productivity has received particular attention in the development literature.

244,Land Tenure Insecurity and Formalizing Land Rights in Madagascar: A Gender Perspective on the Certification Program,"This contribution examines Madagascar's land tenure reform – aimed at reducing land tenure insecurity – from a gender perspective. In particular, it investigates the certification program issuing formal land title deeds (land certificates) to landholders. Drawing on a household survey with gender-disaggregated asset data conducted in the rural municipality Soavinandriana, the analysis suggests that the certification program has strengthened both men's and women's formal claims to individually held land. However, the lack of gender equality principles and, in particular, of mechanisms to ensure that couples’ jointly held land is jointly secured, seems to have reinforced primary ownership of land by male household heads, at the expense of women's land rights.

248,Coercive Harmony in Land Acquisition: The Gendered Impact of Corporate “Responsibility” in the Brazilian Amazon,"In rural development, women's access to land is recognized as a condition for reaching gender equality. This contribution discusses the tension between this formal recognition and concrete realities in rural development for traditional Amazonian communities by examining large-scale land acquisitions in Brazil, a land-abundant developing country, in the wake of the 2007–08 global food price crises. This study applies anthropological and legal perspectives to analyze problems related to gender inequality caused by large-scale land acquisitions. It argues that inequalities cannot be resolved by simply changing regulations related to traditional communities’ and women's rights and that gender relations and land tenure issues reflect interconnected social arrangements based on historical specificities of traditional communities. Case studies show that land acquisitions by outsiders disrupt these arrangements, despite stated commitments to social and environmental responsibility.

259,Critical Perspectives on Financial and Economic Crises: Heterodox Macroeconomics Meets Feminist Economics,"This contribution brings together various strands of analysis about the causes, consequences, and policy ramifications of economic crises, with a specific focus on distributional dynamics. It aims to facilitate a conversation between macroeconomic theorists of crises and instability and feminist economists and scholars of intergroup inequality. Macroeconomic analyses of the Great Recession have centered on the causal role of financial deregulation, capital flow imbalances, and growth of income and wealth inequality.

Rather than wealth, informal lenders seem to rely more on reputation and credit history to screen prospective borrowers, and the consequences of repayment delays or defaults are more severe for women than for men.

291,Maternal Healthcare in Tajikistan: A Bargaining Framework,"This study examines women's declining use of maternal healthcare services in post-socialist Tajikistan. Using data from the 2003 and 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Surveys (TLSS), the findings support previous evidence that a woman's use of prenatal and delivery care depends on her education, household income, and proximity to services. However, previous models have not specified who makes the decision to use maternal healthcare services. This study finds that in Tajikistan a woman shares decision making with her spouse and the eldest woman in the household. There is limited evidence that traditional proxies for bargaining power, such as relative earnings level, affect outcomes. The authors conclude that where women's exit options are limited, surveys evaluating the value of women's assets and their services in the home, as well as questions about decision making, will allow more refined measures of women's bargaining power.","[' Mieke Meurs ', ' Lisa A.

The stereotype of higher absences of women due to family obligations does not seem to fully represent the actual behavior of German employees, at least for the 1985–2001 period. However, the relative importance of specific working conditions and the relative importance of household structure versus amount of time spent in household production differed between men and women.","['sickness absence', 'job characteristic', 'household characteristic', 'ordered probit estimation', 'gender effect']",,"j16,j22,m54",73-97,0,0
306,Skilled Immigrant Women in the US and the Double Earnings Penalty,"Although a large literature exists on the United States labor market experiences of low-skilled immigrant men, relatively few studies have examined the labor market position of highly skilled immigrant women. The current study explores the issue of labor market discrimination and examines the extent to which highly skilled immigrant women experience an earnings disadvantage as a result of both gender status and nativity status. Relying on data from the 2000 US Decennial Census 5-Percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample and using an augmented Oaxaca decomposition technique, this study finds that highly skilled immigrant women do experience a double earnings penalty. In addition, the results suggest that nativity status explains a larger portion of the double earnings penalty than gender status.

Tracking within-person choices over ten dictator exercises in which individuals choose one of three allocations of money between themselves and two other participants, this study precisely maps social preference types and identifies consistency of preferences within groups of roughly two-thirds of participants. Contrary to previous studies that identify a dominant social preference, this study' rigorous identification system reveals that other-regarding individuals are heterogeneous and almost evenly split between inequity aversion and social surplus maximization. But, even among individuals raised in a culture that stresses equal opportunity, there are gender differences.

321,How do Labor Unions Influence the Gender Earnings Gap? A Comparative Study of the US and Korea,"This paper provides a comparative study of the United States and Korea regarding the effects of unions on gender earnings gaps in 2004. Using datasets representative of the population of the US and Korea, this contribution shows that gender differences in the workers' observed characteristics and the unobserved component reduce gender earnings gaps in union jobs in both the US and Korea. Fringe benefits in the union sector attract women workers with higher labor market qualifications into the union sector and thereby reduce the gender earnings gap in this sector. The study finds that this self-selection process in the union sector is stronger in Korea than in the US, but the seniority-based wage system that prevails in the Korean union sector widens the gender earnings gap.","[' Donghun Cho ', ' Joonmo Cho ']","['/author/cho%2c+donghun', '/author/cho%2c+joonmo']",741,16,"'gender earnings gap', 'trade unions', 'comparison of the us and korea'","['J16', 'J31', 'J80']",Pages 133-157,12 Jul 2011,3,2011,17,,"This paper provides a comparative study of the United States and Korea regarding the effects of unions on gender earnings gaps in 2004.

It finds that women living in countries where men participate more in home production are better able to combine having children with market work, leading to greater participation in the labor force at relatively high fertility levels. Within each country however, women with higher relative wages continue to have lower fertility and to participate more in the labor force than lower-paid women due to the higher opportunity cost of remaining at home.

351,Gender Wage Discrimination and Poverty in the EU,"This paper analyzes the role of gender wage discrimination in household poverty rates in several European Union (EU) countries using the European Community Household Panel. In order to quantify the impact of discrimination on poverty, it proposes the construction of a counterfactual distribution of wages where discrimination against women has been removed. Using this new wage distribution, the study computes total household income and compares poverty rates in the absence of discrimination to those actually observed. The results show that, in general, discrimination against women plays a determinative role in the current levels of poverty in EU countries, although results by country show that this role differs in intensity and pattern. Further, the study finds that in EU countries the effect of discrimination on poverty risk dramatically increases for individuals in households that largely depend on working women' earnings.","[' Carlos Gradín ', ' Coral del Río ', ' Olga Cantó ']","['/author/grad%c3%adn%2c+carlos', '/author/del+r%c3%ado%2c+coral', '/author/cant%c3%b3%2c+olga']",1299,25,"'income distribution', 'labor participation', 'gender', 'inequality', 'poverty', 'wage discrimination'",[],Pages 73-109,12 May 2010,2,2010,16,,"This paper analyzes the role of gender wage discrimination in household poverty rates in several European Union (EU) countries using the European Community Household Panel.

Using the combined data sets of survey and the Act's implementation plan, this paper provides logit estimation results to examine empirically how political perceptions or attitudes of firms influence corporate noncompliance with the Act. According to a corporate personnel manager survey, affirmative action was initially pursued as a campaign pledge by the liberal party (the Korea Democratic Party) to attract women's votes, and took on a looser shape as the government compromised with the business sector after an election. A weak enforcement structure ultimately diluted the effects of the Act.

The analysis compares the difference in employment status between partnered mothers and nonmothers across the EU-15 using a wide range of self-constructed indicators of child policies such as childcare provision, parental leave, and tax-cash benefits. Using the recycled predictions method, it is possible to isolate the impact of the presence of a child from other characteristics likely to influence women's labor-market outcomes. Country-specific employment gaps among women are computed at different ages for the youngest child, for different outcomes (inactivity and part-time or full-time work), and for different levels of education.

Gender gaps in employment appear to have an increasing effect on economic growth differences between regions, with the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia suffering from slower growth in female employment.","['economic development', 'economic growth', 'economics gender', 'jel code j7', 'j16', 'o4']",": j7, j16, o4'","j7,j16,o4",91-132,0,0
366,Do Gender Disparities in Employment Increase Profitability? Evidence from the United States,"This paper investigates whether the contribution of the declining share of wages in national income to the upswing in profitability between 1982 and 1997 in the United States was aided by the growing incorporation of women into employment. The analysis finds that women helped moderate the decline in the aggregate wage share. The reduction in gender pay disparity overwhelmed the negative effect of women's growing share of market work on the wage share. However, in (one-digit) sectors where wage shares fell, women did not contribute to restraining the fall, indicating that the aggregate outcome was the net result of distinct sectoral trends in women's employment conditions. We argue that the perverse process of labor productivity falling faster than the real wage in the service sector may have played a key role in shaping the aggregate outcome.

Evidence from India,"This paper analyzes the factors that influence the conditions under which a woman in India participates as a home-based worker using secondary level data at the micro level. At the macro level, the paper analyzes whether trade and industrial liberalization in India led to an increase in subcontracted work, of the home-based variety. The results show a historically high share of women in home-based work, which implies that female participation in such work was more likely to be determined by their cultural milieu than by the recent liberalization process. Further, while the micro model of social determinants appears to fit the female home-based work equation, the macro model is found to be insignificant.

This paper analyzes the gendered employment outcomes of various investment options in Kenya using Social Accounting Matrix multiplier analysis. Results reveal that Kenya's agriculture sector accounts for the highest increase in employee compensation (mainly benefiting skilled labor and disproportionately benefiting men), while its manufacturing sector accounts for the largest share of job creation. Although women stand to benefit more from employment creation, most of these new jobs are informal with low wages. Kenya's gender disparities are a reflection of existing disparities in its labor market and socioeconomic structure.

382,Gender and Access to Antiretroviral Treatment in South Africa,"This paper explores the gender dimensions of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in South Africa. It shows that women are more vulnerable to HIV infection than men, but that women access HAART in disproportionately large numbers. Regression analysis on data from the South African Demographic and Health Survey suggests that men in general access health services less readily than women. This ‘masculinity factor’ accounts for most of the difference between men and women when it comes to accessing HAART. Although men were more likely to favor traditional medicine than women, this was not a statistically significant factor, and it appears that visiting a traditional healer is complementary to, rather than a substitute for, accessing HAART. In short, it seems that gendered norms that make it difficult for men to admit weakness and seek medical attention are the main probable cause for the low proportions of men accessing HAART.",[' Nicoli Nattrass '],['/author/nattrass%2c+nicoli'],698,33,"'aids', 'antiretroviral', 'south africa', 'gender', 'healthcare', 'jel codes: i, j'",[],Pages 19-36,10 Nov 2008,4,2008,14,"AIDS, Sexuality, and Economic Development","This paper explores the gender dimensions of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in South Africa.

Drawing from the ongoing debate about the rhetoric of economic inquiry and significance tests, this paper examines approaches for presenting empirical results effectively to ensure that the analysis is accurate, meaningful, and relevant for the conceptual and empirical context. To that end, it demonstrates several measurement issues that affect the interpretation of economic significance and are commonly overlooked in empirical studies. This paper provides guidelines for clearly communicating two distinct aspects of “significance” in empirical research, using prose, tables, and charts based on OLS, logit, and probit regression results.

399,“Opting out?” The effect of children on women's employment in the United States,"In the United States, a recent spate of popular media attention has focused on whether mothers, especially highly educated mothers in their thirties, are increasingly “opting out” of employment.

412,Foreign direct investment and gendered wages in urban China,"This paper documents the changing impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on gendered wages in urban China. Combining household survey data from 1995 and 2002 with province-level macro-data, the paper finds that FDI as a proportion of investment has a sizable and statistically significant positive effect on both female and male wages in both years.

Yet a study of nineteenth-century England shows substantial groups of women investing for income, capital growth, or a share in the family business. This article will summarize the evidence for women as investors and consider why their participation has been until recently largely ignored by scholars.

Wives are typically younger than their husbands and have longer life expectancy, so they must expect to finance a longer retirement period. Therefore, when they have greater relative bargaining power, households will accumulate more wealth. There is some weak evidence for this in the United States, but this article finds the opposite pattern in New Zealand, where women's greater bargaining power results in a lower net worth in the pre-retirement cohort of couples. In New Zealand, where public pensions are more generous than in the US and are not affected by holdings of private wealth or income, it may not be rational for women with greater relative bargaining power than their spouses to favor wealth accumulation.

This paper documents inequality of access and low quality of care for the elderly in the United States. It argues that public funds used to subsidize nursing homes are poorly spent and that profit-maximizing competition in the nursing home industry adversely affects the quality of care provided. In seeking to address these problems, policy-makers can learn important lessons from several different sources. The experiences of several European countries, current regulatory efforts in the state of Massachusetts, and more decentralized volunteer efforts to promote humane visions of eldercare all offer some hope for the future.","['eldercare', 'care work', 'nursing home', 'long-term care', 'public policy']",,,37-51,0,0

457,Australia's “Other” Gender Wage Gap: Baby Boomers and Compulsory Superannuation Accounts,"Government budgetary pressures and demographic trends have made retirement income policy a priority in developed economies. One option for policy reform is to increase private saving. In Australia, legislation requiring compulsory employer payments for the purposes of retirement savings addresses this option. This system poses particular difficulties for women who have broken patterns of paid employment and relatively low wages. When simulations that project likely employment participation and retirement outcomes incorporate a gendered approach and focus on the “baby boomer” cohort, the results highlight the low probability that women will accumulate adequate independent private retirement income. Over their lifetimes, Australian women baby boomers will spend around 35 percent less time in paid employment than their male counterparts.

473,The dilemmas of lone motherhood: key issues for feminist economics,"The acute dilemmas facing lone mothers in raising their children and earning a living form a common theme across the articles in this special issue of Feminist Economics on Lone Mothers. Like other parents, lone mothers face difficult decisions in allocating their time to caregiving and income generation, but in their families there is only one adult to do both. Further, that one adult is a woman, who will generally earn less than a man, compounding the difficulties. Lone mothers must rely on a range of support mechanisms (fathers, other family members, employers, and government policy) to manage; they can therefore rarely be economically independent. Policies that are ideologically reluctant to support unmarried mothers in their caregiving may divide unmarried mothers from other lone mothers, and lone mothers from other poor parents.

This examination of power continues the exploration of intergroup relationships that Sen has advocated, and it can be expected to yield new criteria for policy evaluation as well as new policy options.","['welfare', 'social choice', 'sen', 'democratization', 'power', 'freedom']",,,117-135,0,1

Further, when training is broken down by type, women also participated more than men did in the three possible categories: on-the-job training, employer-supported off-the-job training, and off-the-job training without employer support. These results challenge conventional expectations derived from human capital theory. Finally, our estimates indicate that occupational segregation accounted for more than one-third of the gender differences in training in 1995 and for more than 40 percent in on-the-job and employer-supported, off-the-job training categories.","['training', 'human capital investment', 'woman economy', 'occupational segregation']",,,21-53,0,0

Using data from the Second European Survey on Working Conditions , the author seeks to address this question. The paper examines four regimes of part-time employment. The gender-roles model, which assumes that women work parttime because they are secondary earners or have children at home, ranks first as a predictor of the likelihood that a woman will work part-time. In the responsive firms model, which ranks second in explanatory power, part-time work is primarily seen as the firms' response to workers' demands for fewer working hours. The optimal staffing model assumes that employers will create part-time jobs as a response to the demand for time-related services; it ranks third in explanatory power.

547,Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income,"A citizens' basic income scheme is based on the principles of individuality, universality, and unconditionality; when combined with the notion of meeting ""basic needs"" it would serve to provide a minimum income guarantee for all adult members of society. However, implementation would entail radical reform of existing patterns of welfare delivery and would bring into question the institutionalized relationship between work and welfare, a basic premise of modern welfare states.

549,Mature Export-Led Growth and Gender Wage Inequality in Taiwan,"After 1980, the Taiwanese economy was marked by technological change, growing overseas investment by Taiwanese firms, and continuing success with export-oriented manufacturing. In the manufacturing sector these developments coincided with a decline in women's employment opportunities relative to men's, a shift from wage to salaried employment, and an increase in gender wage inequality. Using industry-level panel data, this study investigates the effects of Taiwan's restructuring during this period on gender wage inequality. The most important findings are: greater export orientation adversely affects both men's and women's wages yet reduces gender wage inequality, because male employees face a greater wage penalty than women; greater capital intensity improves both men's and women's wages; and the shift toward salaried jobs improves men's wages while reducing wages of women.

This paper argues that gender wage inequality has stimulated growth, with Asian economies that disadvantaged women the most growing the fastest from 1975 to 1990. Low female wages have spurred investment and exports by lowering unit labor costs, providing the foreign exchange to purchase capital and intermediate goods which raise productivity and growth rates. These results contrast with recent studies that argue income equality at the household level contributed favorably to Asian growth by reducing political conflict.

605,Basic Needs Budgets Revisited: Does the U.S. Consumer Price Index Overestimate the Changes in the Cost of Living for Low-Income Families?,"The consumer price index (CPI) is used in the United States to measure changes in the cost of living. Since the CPI is used to index the official U.S. poverty guidelines and to establish eligibility criteria for various public assistance programs, a change in the methodology used to calculate the CPI would impact the accuracy of poverty statistics and, more importantly, poor families' access to public assistance. Since the majority of these poor families are headed by women, the CPI becomes a critical issue for feminist economics. In December 1996 the United States Senate Finance Committee's Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index issued its final report which concluded that use of the consumer price index results in widespread substantial overindexing. This paper uses the basic needs budgets (BNB) to evaluate changes in the cost of living for low-income families. The author compares the cost of the BNBs for single-parent families in 1983 and 1996 and finds that the cost of the bundle of goods and services included in the BNBs has increased faster than the CPI.

Average gender salary differences are negative at every rank and at every category of U.S. institution with or without collective bargaining agreement. Unions may improve gender salary differentials somewhat, particularly at the assistant professor level. There is no evidence that this gain will be lost at higher levels, and mixed evidence that further gains occur for women at the full professor level. The most pervasive and robust consequence of unions is to increase the positive impact that higher proportions of women at senior faculty ranks make on relative salaries at the assistant professor level. However, the influence of these higher-ranked women on gender salary inequalities at the associate and full levels is lower in union schools than nonunion schools.

626,National Working-Time Regimes and Equal Opportunities,Progress towards equal opportunities is critically dependent upon the development of a more equal and more balanced allocation of time in both paid and unpaid work. Gender divisions relating to working time arise primarily from differences in gender divisions within the household but the extent and form that these gender divisions take in the labor market are moderated or mediated by national working-time regimes. These regimes are found to be extremely diverse across Europe with very different implications for gender equality. Current interests in greater flexibility in working time are leading to pressures to changes in working-time regimes and to an increase in the extent of unsocial hours working. The strategies adopted to meet these pressures may vary by country and sector but the restructuring of working time is also likely to be influenced by gender factors and divisions. The result may be increasing differentiation by both gender and class.

627,Deregulation and Women's Employment: The Diverse Experiences of Women in Britain,"In recent years employers in Britain have taken up equal opportunity policies more widely and structural changes in the economy have generally favored women. Against this, the pursuit of labor market deregulation is generally thought to impact adversely on women. This paper considers the changing British policy framework of the last ten to fifteen years and the effects on women's employment, highlighting differences amongst women. Deregulation and flexibilization are argued to have affected the conditions of part-time employment for women rather than its scale and pattern of expansion. The changing gender wage gap in Britain and the growth of pay inequalities amongst women are analyzed using a shift-share approach. The limited convergence in earnings between men and women is largely confined to full-time workers and has two distinct aspects. Full-time female employees have made some inroads into higher-paid occupations, but at the bottom end of the market the narrowing of the gender wage gap reflects little more than the deterioration in the position of low-paid men, relative to the median. The British case shows the limitations of an equal opportunities agenda pursued within a wider regime of burgeoning labor market inequalities.","[' Irene Bruegel ', ' Diane Perrons ']","['/author/bruegel%2c+irene', '/author/perrons%2c+diane']",262,14,"'britain', 'gender wage gap', 'deregulation', 'equal opportunity policies', 'labor market inequalities'",[],Pages 103-125,02 Dec 2010,1,1998,4,,"In recent years employers in Britain have taken up equal opportunity policies more widely and structural changes in the economy have generally favored women.

628,Suckling and Silence in the USA: The Costs and Benefits of Breastfeeding,"Feminist literature has highlighted the way in which pregnancy and childbearing signal ''difference'' from the male labor market norm. The issue of breastfeeding adds complexity to this analysis. This paper argues that, in labor market terms, there are costs attached to breastfeeding for most women. However, health-focused research indicates that there are also significant benefits conferred by breastfeeding to mothers, infants, employers and wider society in industrialized as well as in so-called ''developing'' economies. In this essay, I argue that although the dominant American discourse on infant feeding emphasizes personal preference on the part of individual women there are, in fact, significant economic and employment-related factors which impinge on infant feeding options. In particular, those women in the most disadvantaged positions in the labor market are, in general, the most constrained in terms of such choice. However, while pregnancy and childbirth have been the subject of intense feminist interest and debate, breastfeeding and its intersection with women's increasing participation in paid work has not been foregrounded either within feminist equality/difference debates or within recent labor market analyses.

Margaret Reid's ''third party criterion,'' a definition of economic activity advocated by many feminists and one used to set the production boundary for most household production models, sets an implicit market standard for defining nonmarket economic activity and therefore contributes to the marginalization of such production.

A ''first world'' criterion implicit in such production boundaries defines nonmarket activity as work only if it would have been dealt with on the market in the first world; this results in the inclusion of some of the unpaid domestic activity of rural women on grounds which reinforce the exclusion of work such as child care and the preparation of meals in theory and policy.

633,Lone Mothers and Paid Work - Rational Economic Man or Gendered Moral Rationalities?,"In this article we examine the inadequacies of the rational economic man approach for understanding individual economic decision-making, and we suggest an alternative concept which we call ''gendered moral rationalities.'' We carry out this critique in the context of research on lone motherhood and paid work. This is an important social and political issue where analyses commonly use the rational economic man approach (although often only implicitly). However, these analyses have not, we argue, been able to understand the social processes by which lone mothers take up, or do not take up, paid work. In this paper we take the debate further by using recent empirical work on the employment position and values of lone mothers in Britain, integrating information from interviews with census data. The results suggest that it is nonmarket, collective relations and understandings about motherhood and employment which are the primary factors in explaining lone mothers' uptake of paid work. We term these ''gendered moral rationalities.'' While individual levels of human capital and policy constraints remain important, in a causal sense these are best seen as contingent, secondary factors. The source of economic rationality therefore, at least in this case, primarily lies outside the market and in the domain of collective, and highly gendered, understandings about proper social behavior.

The results suggest that departments that use publication in general journals as a proxy for overall research quality, and which do not consider alternative evaluations of research as potential full substitutes, may be using biased measures of the quality and importance of research on gender. The publication policies of general economics journals and the promotion policies of certain economics departments may have a direct effect in reducing both the number and perceived prestige of voices addressing issues of gender in economics.","['gender topic', 'u economics journal', 'publication trend', 'female economist']",,,129-135,0,0

679,A gender analysis of U.S. labor market policies for the working poor,"Current anti-poverty policy proposals focus on welfare reform to the exclusion of reforming the low-wage labor market. In contrast, we compare two policy proposals aimed at low-wage labor markets: a national comparable worth policy and an increase in the minimum wage.

Our findings suggest that while both would reduce poverty among working women, the impact of a comparable worth policy on female poverty would be greater under most scenarios presented. It is estimated that an increase of 96 cents per hour in the national minimum wage would be necessary to equal the poverty reduction effect for women workers of a comparable worth policy which excludes small employers. Both policies decrease the incidence of povertylevel wages less among men, since roughly 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women.

680,Gender earnings inequality in the service and manufacturing industries in the U.S.,"This paper compares earnings inequality between women and men in a growing sector of the U.S. economy – the service sector, and a shrinking sector – manufacturing. We examine the hypothesis that deindustrialization will reduce inequality, and find that the absolute magnitude of the gender earnings gap is, in fact, smaller in the service sector. Decomposition analysis is used to partition the gender earnings gap into three parts: (1) earnings differences due to differences in mean characteristics – such as education and experience; (2) earnings differences due to preferential treatment of men; and (3) earnings differences due to disadvantageous treatment of women. The latter two constitute estimates of gender discrimination. The results of this study suggest that, ceteris paribus, deirndustrialization will likely reduce the gender gap in hourly earnings. However, this will come at the cost of lower earnings for both males and females, with the drop in earnings being particularly large for males.

685,The discovery of “unpaid work”: the social consequences of the expansion of “work”,"This paper questions the dichotomy of work/nonwork. It examines the way in which the category of work was expanded by feminists and economists to include much domestic activity, and considers some of the consequences of this expansion. It argues that the discovery of unpaid “work” involved an uncritical application and validation of a concept of work abstracted from a model of commodity producing wage labor in manufacturing. However, this concept excludes much of what is distinctive about domestic activities, such as their caring and self-fulfilling aspects. Inequality between households has become a conduit for the construction of needs in a form in which “work,” and in particular work for money, is needed to satisfy them. Some consequences of this tendency are examined together with the policy concerns which would need to be addressed in order to mitigate its deleterious effects.

686,Women's education and economic well-being,"Evidence across regions in the world reveals patterns in school enrollment ratios and literacy that are divided along gender lines. In the developing world, apart from most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, enrollment ratios of girls lag behind those for boys at all levels of education. Worldwide literacy rates for adult men far exceed those for women. While educational progress has been enjoyed by both sexes, these advances have failed to eradicate the gender gap. Education enhances labor market productivity and income growth for all, yet educating women has beneficial effects on social well-being not always measured by the market. Rising levels of education improve women's productivity in the home which in turn can increase family health, child survival, and the investment in children's human capital. The social benefits from women's education range from fostering economic growth to extending the average life expectancy in the population, to improving the functioning of political processes.

Examples of gender-based models of the family reveal the limitations of applying those models to the families of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, since gay families face very different legal, political, and cultural constraints and opportunities. However, variations in family forms and behavior that are rooted in sexual orientation differences provide opportunities for new feminist research strategies for studying the influence of gender norms and family legal institutions on economic behavior, for instance. And finally, feminists can also learn from and contribute to the political efforts of lesbian and gay activists who are creating new forms of legally and materially recognized relationships between adults.",[' M.

703,Becker's theory of the family: Preposterous conclusions,"Economic theory as applied to the family should increase our understanding of the phenomena we are studying, and allow us to implement fruitful intervention in cases where we are not satisfied with what is occurring. Much if not all of the theory of the family fails to achieve these aims. Examples are given from the most recent edition of Gary Becker's Theory of the Family, where the analysis leads to conclusions that are, on their face, preposterous. This kind of theorizing leads, as does almost all neoclassical theory, to a conclusion that the institutions depicted are benign, and that government intervention would be useless at best and probably harmful.

704,Social/institutional variables and behavior within households: An empirical test using the Luxembourg income study,"High on the research agenda of feminist economists is the development of better models of what goes on within families. This paper contributes by conducting empirical tests of the impact of social/institutional factors on behavior within marriage. As one example, “divorce-threat” bargaining models predict that greater certainty of receiving child support should increase a woman's bargaining power within a marriage and hence observable behavioral outcomes. Within a single country, there is limited variation in the social/institutional factors which might affect bargaining power, but across countries identifying variation can be found. Thus, we use a micro-data set constructed using seven countries from the Luxembourg Income Study database in order to estimate a probit model of the labor-force participation of married women. Our conclusions suggest that, contrary to the predictions of Becker-style unitary models, some social/institutional factors do influence individual behavior within the household.","[' Shelley Phipps ', ' Peter Burton ']","['/author/phipps%2c+shelley', '/author/burton%2c+peter']",77,16,"'intra-household ', 'institutional ', 'family ', 'feminist ', 'power '",[],Pages 151-174,18 Jun 2010,1,1995,1,,"High on the research agenda of feminist economists is the development of better models of what goes on within families.

705,Restacking the deck: Family policy and women's fall-back position in Germany before and after unification,"This paper examines some of the effects of East and West German family policy on women's economic position by analyzing intrahousehold bargaining power, defined here as based on co-resident partners' relative fall-back positions, which in turn depend on the individuals' access to income in the event that the partnership ends. East German policy sought to integrate women into the labor force through programs such as free public child care and liberal maternity leave. West Germany based its family policy on the assumption of a stark gender division of labor, with one lifetime breadwinner per family and a second parent who temporarily leaves the labor force to raise children. On the basis of her findings and analysis, the author argues that while East German institutions increased women's bargaining power, gender-specific policies interfered with women's ability to use this power to bring about changes in the household division of labor. West German family policy did not assign gender roles, but it offered women less bargaining power with which to negotiate. The author maintains that society's refusal to address women's greater child-rearing costs is not based on an assessment of such costs and the costs of redistributive government programs, but on the assumption that women should absorb the risks and burdens of reproduction.",[' Lynn Duggan '],['/author/duggan%2c+lynn'],77,15,"'family policy ', 'bargaining power ', 'germany ', 'child-rearing ', 'costs ', 'housework ', 'household work ', 'socialism '",[],Pages 175-194,18 Jun 2010,1,1995,1,,"This paper examines some of the effects of East and West German family policy on women's economic position by analyzing intrahousehold bargaining power, defined here as based on co-resident partners' relative fall-back positions, which in turn depend on the individuals' access to income in the event that the partnership ends.

706,Do young women trade jobs for marriage? A skeptical view,"This paper takes a skeptical view of the theory that the slight decline in young women's labor-force participation from 1985 to 1990 can be explained by the fact that there are fewer women now in their early twenties than there are men in their late twenties so that women currently have more bargaining power in the marriage market than men do.The paper argues that the assumption behind this theory, that for women marriage and employment are substitutes, is outmoded. It also contends that the theory leaves out the importance of full-time schooling as an activity alternative to employment and that in fact the increase in full-time schooling among young women has been much greater than the slight decrease in their labor-force participation.Several questions are raised about the statistical test of the theory and also about the reasons why the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page article on the slight decline in young women's labor-force participation and featured the marriage market theory as an explanation for this purported new trend.",[' Myra Strober '],['/author/strober%2c+myra'],40,1,"""women's labor-force participation "", 'marriage markets ', ""young women's full-time enrollment in school "", ""media portrayal of women's issues "", ""women's utility functions "", 'rich husband thesis '",[],Pages 197-205,18 Jun 2010,1,1995,1,,"This paper takes a skeptical view of the theory that the slight decline in young women's labor-force participation from 1985 to 1990 can be explained by the fact that there are fewer women now in their early twenties than there are men in their late twenties so that women currently have more bargaining power in the marriage market than men do.The paper argues that the assumption behind this theory, that for women marriage and employment are substitutes, is outmoded.
